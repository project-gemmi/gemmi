GEMMI can help if you work with:

* macromolecular models (from mmCIF, PDB and mmJSON files),
* refinement restraints (CIF files),
* crystallographic reflections (from MTZ and SF-mmCIF files),
* electron density maps (MRC/CCP4 files),
* crystallographic symmetries,
* or if you just read and write CIF/STAR files (where C=Crystallographic).

GEMMI is a header-only C++11 library accompanied by:

* command-line [tools](https://gemmi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utils.html),
* Python bindings (supporting CPython and PyPy),
* Fortran 2003+ interface (in progress),
* WebAssembly ports (see [here](https://project-gemmi.github.io/wasm/) and
  [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mtz)),
* and little data viz [projects](https://project-gemmi.github.io/pdb-stats/).
