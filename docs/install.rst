C++ library
-----------

Before version 0.6 gemmi was a header-only library.
Some functions are still in headers. If you use only such function,
you only need to ensure that the `include` directory is in your
include path when compiling your program. For example::

    git clone https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi.git
    c++ -Igemmi/include -O2 my_program.cpp

Otherwise, you either need to build gemmi_cpp library,
or add (selected) files from src/ to your project.

If you use **CMake**, you may

* use find_package for installed gemmi::

    find_package(gemmi 0.6.4 CONFIG REQUIRED)

* or add gemmi as a git submodule and use add_subdirectory::

    add_subdirectory(gemmi EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

* or use FetchContent::

    add_subdirectory(gemmi EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
    include(FetchContent)
    FetchContent_Declare(
      gemmi
      GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi.git
      GIT_TAG        ...
    )
    FetchContent_GetProperties(gemmi)
    if (NOT gemmi_POPULATED)
      FetchContent_Populate(gemmi)
      add_subdirectory(${gemmi_SOURCE_DIR} ${gemmi_BINARY_DIR} EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
    endif()

Then, to find headers and link your target with the library, use::

    target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE gemmi::gemmi_cpp)

If only headers are needed, do::

    target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE gemmi::headers)

The gemmi::headers interface, which is also included in gemmi::gemmi_cpp,
adds two things: include dictory and *compile feature* cxx_std_11 (a minimal
requirement for the compilation).

Gemmi can be compiled with either zlib or zlib-ng.
The only difference is that zlib-ng is faster.
Here are the relevant cmake options:

* FETCH_ZLIB_NG -- download, build statically, and use zlib-ng.
* USE_ZLIB_NG -- find zlib-ng installed on the system.
* INTERNAL_ZLIB -- compile third_party/zlib (a subset of zlib distributed
  with gemmi).
* None of the above -- find zlib installed on the system;
  if not found, use third_party/zlib.

On Windows, when a program or library is linked with zlib(-ng) DLL,
it may require the DLL to be in the same directory.
It is simpler to build zlib-ng statically or use `-D FETCH_ZLIB_NG=ON`.

----

Note on Unicode: if a file name is passed to Gemmi (through `std::string`)
it is assumed to be in ASCII or UTF-8.

.. _install_py:

Python module
-------------

From PyPI
~~~~~~~~~

To install the gemmi module do::

    pip install gemmi

We have binary wheels for several Python versions (for all supported CPython
versions and one PyPy version), so the command usually downloads binaries.
If a matching wheel is not available,
the module is compiled from source -- it takes a few minutes
and requires a C++ compiler that supports C++17.

Gemmi 0.7+ supports only Python 3.8+.

Other binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use the `CCP4 suite <https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/>`_,
you can find gemmi there.

If you use Anaconda Python, you can install
`package conda <https://github.com/conda-forge/gemmi-feedstock>`_
from conda-forge::

    conda install -c conda-forge gemmi

These distribution channels may have an older version of gemmi.

From git
~~~~~~~~

The latest version can be installed directly from the repository.
Either use::

    pip install git+https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi.git

or clone the `project <https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi/>`_
(or download a zip file) and from the top-level directory do::

    pip install .

On Windows, Python should automatically find an appropriate compiler (MSVC).
If the compiler is not installed, pip shows a message with a download link.

Building with pip uses scikit-build-core and CMake underneath.
You might pass options to CMake either as the `--config-settings` option
of pip (in recent pip versions only)::

  pip install . --config-settings="cmake.args=-DFETCH_ZLIB_NG=ON"

or using environment variables such as `CMAKE_ARGS`. See
`scikit-build-core docs <https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#configuring-cmake-arguments-and-defines>`_
for details.

If gemmi is already installed, uninstall the old version first
(`pip uninstall`) or add option `--upgrade`.

Alternatively, you can manually install nanobind and cmake (using pip)
and build a cloned project directly with CMake::

    cmake -D USE_PYTHON=1 .
    make -j4 gemmi_py

Fortran and C bindings
----------------------

The Fortran bindings are in early stage and are not documented yet.
They use the ISO_C_BINDING module introduced in Fortran 2003
and `shroud <https://github.com/LLNL/shroud>`_.
You may see the `fortran/` directory to know what to expect.
This directory contains Makefile -- run make to built the bindings.
(They are currently not integrated with the cmake build.)

..
 The bindings and usage examples can be compiled with CMake::

    cmake -D USE_FORTRAN=1 .
    make

The C bindings are used only for making Fortran bindings,
but they should be usable on their own.

..
 If you use cmake to build the project
 you get a static library `libcgemmi.a` that can be used from C,
 together with the :file:`fortran/*.h` headers.

Program
-------

The library comes with a command-line program also named `gemmi`.

Binaries
~~~~~~~~

Binaries are distributed with the CCP4 suite and with Global Phasing software.
They are also in `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/gemmi-program/>`_
(`pip install gemmi-program`) and
`conda-forge packages <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/gemmi/files>`_.

The very latest builds (as well as a little older ones)
can be downloaded from CI jobs:

- for Windows --
  click the first (green) job in
  `AppVeyor CI <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wojdyr/gemmi>`_
  and find gemmi.exe in the Artifacts tab,
- for Linux and Mac -- sign in to GitHub (no special permissions are needed,
  but GitHub requires sign-in for artifacts),
  click the first job (with âœ…) in
  `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi/actions/workflows/ci.yml>`_
  and download a zip file from the Artifacts section.

From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

To build it from source, first make sure you have git, cmake and C++ compiler
installed (on Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git cmake make g++`), then::

    git clone https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi.git
    cd gemmi
    cmake .
    make

Testing
-------

The main automated tests are in Python::

    python3 -m unittest discover -v tests/

We also have doctest tests in the documentation, and some others.
All of them can be run from the `run-tests.sh` script in the repository.
