If CIF_FILE is -, the output is printed to stdout.
If spec is -, it is read from stdin.

Lines in the spec file have format:
  [FLAG] COLUMN TYPE TAG [FORMAT]
for example:
  SIGF_native * SIGF_meas_au 12.5e
  FREE I pdbx_r_free_flag 3.0f
FLAG (optional) is either ? or &:
  ? = ignored if no column is the MTZ file has this name.
  & = ignored if the previous line was ignored.
  Example:
      ? I    J intensity_meas
      & SIGI Q intensity_sigma
COLUMN is MTZ column label. Columns H K L are added if not specified.
  Alternative labels can be separated with | (e.g. FREE|FreeR_flag).
TYPE is used for checking the columm type, unless it is '*'.
TAG does not include category name, it is only the part after _refln.
FORMAT (optional) is printf-like floating-point format:
 - one of e, f, g with optional flag, width and precision
 - flag is one of + - # _; '_' stands for ' ', for example '_.4f'
 - since all numbers in MTZ are stored as float, the integer columns use
   the same format as float. The format of _refln.status is ignored.
